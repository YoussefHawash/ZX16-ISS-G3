# G3 - ZX16 Instruction Set Simulator (ISS)

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to design and implement an **Instruction Set Simulator (ISS)** for the **ZX16 architecture** - an open-source, educational ISA inspired by RISC-V and developed at the American University in Cairo (AUC). Our simulator emulates the ZX16 CPU, handles memory and register operations, executes binary-encoded instructions, and supports both terminal and visual testing environments, while enriching user experience with tools that will help them throught the simulation such as, **Memory Inspector** and **Binary to Hex Converter**.

We extended the project with a complete **graphical frontend**, making it intuitive for users to load `.bin` files, step through instructions, and visually debug CPU behavior.

## Key Features

- **Full ZX16 ISA instruction support**

- **Real-time disassembling** via a custom-built disassembler

- **64 KB memory map** with hardware-mapped I/O

- **2D Tiled Graphics System** (320 \* 240 QVGA resolution)

- **Interactive Keyboard Input**

- **Register tracking**, updated every clock cycle

- **Terminal with CLI-like logging**

- **Step, Pause, Resume** execution control

- **Web Interface** built with Next.js + Monaco Editor

- **Built-in Assembler** for easier Devlopment Enviroment

## Design Overview

### Backend (Simulator)

- Implemented in `cpu.ts`, the simulator that handles the **fetch-decode-execute** cycle.

- Utilizes a **disassembler** (`disassembler.ts`) to map binary instructions to readable ZX16 assembly.

- Implements `ecall`-based system calls for I/O, audio, memory dumps, and termination.

- Tracks a program counter, 8 general-purpose registers (`x0-x7`), and memory changes on every clock cycle.
- Integerated Assembler for easier devlopement 

### Frontend (UI)

- Built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.

- Integrates **Monaco Editor** for instruction visualization with custom syntax highlighting.

- Custom components visualize:

- CPU state (registers)

- Tile-based screen display

- Terminal command interaction

- File upload and memory binding

## Build Instructions & Usage Guide

You should have **Node Js** install on your device through this [Link](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd  ./z16-sim

npm  install 

```

### Run Locally

```bash

npm run dev

```

Navigate to the link provided in the cmd response after **" Local: "**

### Interface Controls

- **Upload `.bin`**: Load compiled ZX16 binary file

- **Play/Pause**: Control clock-driven instruction execution

- **Step**: Manual single-instruction stepping

- **View**:

- Assembly (Monaco)

- Registers

- Graphics display

- Keyboard input

- Console logs

## Testing Strategy

All test files are stored in `tests/`:

```

tests/

â”œâ”€â”€ TC-ZX16-01.s

â”œâ”€â”€ TC-ZX16-01.bin

â”œâ”€â”€ TC-ZX16-01.expected

...

```

Each test case is documented with:

- Test ID & Objective

- Steps

- Expected register/memory/console state

---

### Test ID: TC-ZX16-01

#### Objective: Testing J-Type and B-type Instructions

#### Expected Results: x3=x4=5,x5=42, the rest stay unmodified

---

### Test ID: TC-ZX16-02

#### Objective: Testing I-Type Instructions and Two Ecalls

#### Expected Results: x2= -1 , x3 = -1, and the rest stay unmodified

---

### Test ID: TC-ZX16-03

#### Objective: TestingR-Type Instructions and Two Ecalls

#### Expected Results: x1=x5= -4 , x2=x3=-1, the rest stay unmodified

# Project Challenges
## ðŸš€ Enabling High Refresh Rates with Multithreading

One of the core challenges in this project was achieving a smooth, high-frequency screen refresh (~60 FPS) without sacrificing CPU execution speed. Initially, the rendering loop and instruction execution were coupled within the React component lifecycle, which led to laggy performance due to Reactâ€™s render overhead and JavaScriptâ€™s single-threaded nature.

To overcome this, we adopted **Web Workers** and **`SharedArrayBuffer`** to offload CPU execution into a separate thread. This enabled true multithreading:

- **CPU Execution Thread**: A Web Worker runs the CPU's instruction loop in a tight `while` loop, using `Atomics` to manage execution state (e.g., `Paused`, `Running`, `Halted`) in a shared state buffer.
- **UI Thread**: The React main thread handles screen rendering independently, periodically reading the latest video memory and re-rendering the canvas at a consistent rate (e.g., using `requestAnimationFrame` or `setInterval`).

By decoupling CPU computation from UI rendering:

-  We achieved **independent frame updates**, eliminating stutter caused by blocking CPU logic.
- **Memory synchronization** was efficiently managed through shared buffers without repeated message passing.
-  The architecture simulated a **hardware-like environment**, where CPU and display operate asynchronously yet coherently.

This approach allowed us to emulate real-time behavior and maintain visual responsiveness â€” a crucial requirement for a responsive simulator.
